      <h1>Classifying Wildfires in Satellite Imagery</h1>
      <h2>Connor Couture, Shirley Qi, Joseph Wong</h2>
      <p>
        As the impacts of climate change begin to be felt, wildfires have become
        a regular occurrence all over the world. With wildfires becoming more
        common, it is important to have an efficient and accurate way to
        identify the areas burned by wildfires. With satellite data widely
        available in today's world, there is now enough data to train a model to
        identify these areas. Using the Satellite Burned Area Dataset, we
        trained several models to identify areas from satellite images which
        have burn scars from recent wildfires. The UNet architecture
        (implemented in PyTorch) is one of the top models for medical image
        segmentation, so this was one of the models we decided to experiment on
        for this dataset. Some other models we trained on this dataset include a
        fine-tuned version of Meta's Segment Anything model, and FastAI model.
